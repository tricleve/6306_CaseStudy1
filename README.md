# Budweiser Presentation
The purpose of this project is to explore the data of two data sets: breweries and beer.  
The exploration is to answer the following questions:
 - Where are breweries located in the United States?
 - Where did we land post data clean up?
 - What is the median ABV and IBU in each state?
 - Who has the most alcoholic and most bitter beer?
 - What does the ABV distribution look like in the United States?
 - Is there a relationship between ABV and IBU?
 - Can we create a model to identify a beer as IPAs?
 - What markets are good test areas for a new beer?
